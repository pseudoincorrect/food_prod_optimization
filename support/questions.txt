What does scb_ql means ?

Do you need to way for a certain ammount of value (pixel heights) to run the opti algo ?

Should we use only the last solution ?

if we receive new pixel heights every 10 sec, doest it make sense to calculate the next 30 values, since they will be replaced in 
10 sec by a new calculation ?

What is the timestamp between command to be sent to the robot ?

What timestamp between new input should we aim for ? (10sec, 1 minute)

What is the order of the stacks in the SCB_QL code
